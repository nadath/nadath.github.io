TLDR; Jekyll pulled me out of my existential crisis. In one of my bouts of doubt and panic resignation as I found myself unable to face the reality of corporate work, I decided I need to look for a new job.

### Existential crisis and job hunting

When faced with a self-sabotaging tendency, I have learned to make calculated decisions and never one on impluse. With numbers and calculations, I was convinced I can only quit if I have secured a new job.

I got my CV updated with a new look and digged through [Hiredly](https://my.hiredly.com/), which I couldn't help but admire because of its cool and simple UI.

I had a tiny problem, though.

> The age-old question I could never answer - what do you want to be?

What do I want to do for a living? I know what I don't want - unfortunately that which I have qualifications for. I know what I like - Art and Mathematics.

Narrowing down my options, I had some ideas in mind.

So I came up with a plan for a career pivot:
1. Build a portfolio
2. Learn a niche skill or a new language
3. Start small projects

On to number one,

### Building a portfolio

I have nothing to showcase, yet. But why a portfolio first? 

What prompted me was a job ad for a Rendering Engineer, which seems niche and therefore cool. 

I don't have all of the skills, but that didn't discourage me from applying, what did was: *Link to a website/blog/portfolio: `______` in the application.

Come to think of it, it makes sense to start with a portfolio as I can't prove my skills without enough work experience. 

Building a portfolio is a nice little project to hyperfocus on, plus I get to learn new skills if I build it from scratch.

But scratch "from scratch", it wasn't entirely from scratch. More stories on that later.

So long and goodnight.
