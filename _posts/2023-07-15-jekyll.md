TLDR; Jekyll pulled me out of my existential crisis.

### Existential Crisis and Job Hunting

In one of my bouts of doubt and panic resignation as I found myself unable to face the reality of corporate work, I decided I need to look for a new job, one that allows me to work in a small team, like a startup. I digged through [Hiredly](https://my.hiredly.com/), which I instantly loved mainly because of its cool and simple UI.

I had a tiny problem, though. I was cluesless about where I wanted my career path to lead. I know what I don't want - unfortunately that which directly relates to my degree. I know what I like - Art and Mathematics (and coding). Software developer is the best match.

So here's my plan towards this new career goal:
1. Build a portfolio
2. Learn a niche skill
3. Learn a new language
4. Start small projects

On to number one, to build a portfolio.

### Blogging on Jekyll 

I have nothing to showcase, yet. But why a portfolio first? 

What prompted me was a job ad for a Rendering Engineer, which seems niche and therefore cool. I don't have all of the skills, but that didn't stop me from applying, what stopped me was: *Link to a website/blog/portfolio: _
I couldn't proceed without it.

Come to think of it, it makes sense to start with this as I can't prove my skills with professional experience. Building a portfolio is a nice little project to hyperfocus on, plus I get to learn new skills if I build it from scratch.

> Building a site from scratch with Jekyll, done. 

But scratch "from scratch", it didn't work out. What you're seeing now is built from a forked Jekyll theme. More stories on that later.

So long and noodnight.
