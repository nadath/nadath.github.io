TLDR; How I built my portfolio/blog using Jekyll.

## The problem starts

I successfully installed Jekyll. Had a hiccup in installing ruby using chruby on my Mac, I used rbnev instead and it works. I mainly referred to the docs on [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). Stackoverflow is also a great help in solving the small hiccups, as always.

I managed to publish it on my GitHub pages, but once I tried changing the theme using remote_theme and plugins, the changes didn't appear on my site. I couldn't figure it out. In the end, I forked one of the themes from <https://jamstackthemes.dev/ssg/jekyll/> (they have a few cool ones) and customized from there.

## Hacked Jekyll

Hacked-jekyll is a "microtheme that looks like JSON". I loved the coder/hacker theme. I expanded it by adding a photo gallery, navigation bar, and a blog page. Here's the outcome: https://github.com/nadath/hacking-jekyll.

Thanks to these references:
1. [A simple image gallery in Jekyll without plugins](https://dmnfarrell.github.io/software/jekyll-galleries)
2. [Create a Draggable HTML Element](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_draggable.asp) (idea inspired by draggable posts on [Anon](http://anon.com.hk))

I'm thinking up something cool and weird to customize the blog page further. Let's see how it goes.

For now, we've got to go to the next step,

## Master a niche skill or new language

I've been switching tasks between learning Blender and Javascript. I started some tutorials on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) and [freeCodeCamp(https://www.freecodecamp.org)]. They're awesome and free, but I got bored and distracted easily. I think I've got some idea of HTML, CSS, and Javascript from building my Jekyll site, so that's good enough for a start.

Blender it is.

Let's go!
