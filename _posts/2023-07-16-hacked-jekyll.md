TLDR; I built a portfolio/blog using Jekyll.

## The problem starts

I successfully installed Jekyll, with some hiccup in installing ruby. I had given up on Jekyll once because chruby wouldn't work on my Mac. This time I used rbnev instead and it works.

Following the steps on [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/), I managed to create a site and publish it on my GitHub Pages.

But once I tried changing the theme using remote_theme and plugins, the changes wouldn't appear on my site. 

I couldn't figure it out.

In the end, I forked one of the themes from [Jamstack Themes](https://jamstackthemes.dev/ssg/jekyll/) (they have a few cool ones) and customized from there.

### Hacked Jekyll

I liked this coder-hacker theme called Hacked Jekyll and used it as a homepage. I added a photo gallery, a draggable navigation bar (idea inspired by draggable posts on [Anon](http://anon.com.hk)), and a blog page. 

Big thanks to these references:
1. [A simple image gallery in Jekyll without plugins](https://dmnfarrell.github.io/software/jekyll-galleries)
2. [Create a Draggable HTML Element](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_draggable.asp)

I'm thinking up something cool/weird to customize the blog page further. Let's see how it'd go.

Till then.
