TLDR; Here came the fear of the blank page again.

### The problem starts

I had started on an idea of building a static site using Jekyll some time ago, but abandoned it for some reason.

Taking up on the idea again, but this time hosting it on GitHub Pages, I managed to get it running.

It felt a bit daunting looking at an empty page and thinking of building something from scratch.

I wanted to change the theme to have something to see and build from, but I couldn't figure out how to use plugins.

So I forked a repository and customized from there.

### Hacked Jekyll

I found this cool hacker theme called [Hacked Jekyll](https://github.com/piazzai/hacked-jekyll) and used it as a homepage. I added a photo gallery, a draggable navigation bar (idea inspired by draggable posts on [Anon](http://anon.com.hk)), and a blog page.

Code snippets I used and customized from:
1. [A simple image gallery in Jekyll without plugins](https://dmnfarrell.github.io/software/jekyll-galleries)
2. [Create a Draggable HTML Element](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_draggable.asp)

I'm thinking up something cool/weird to customize the blog page further. Let's see how it'd go.

Till then.
