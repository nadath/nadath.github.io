TLDR; How I built my portfolio/blog using Jekyll.

### The problem starts

> I successfully installed Jekyll, with some hiccup in installing ruby using chruby on my Mac. I used rbnev instead and it works. 

> I mainly referred to the docs on [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) is a great help in solving the small hiccups, as always.

> I managed to create a site and publish it on my GitHub Pages, but once I tried changing the theme using remote_theme and plugins, the changes wouldn't appear on my site. 

>I couldn't figure it out. 

> In the end, I forked one of the themes from [Jamstack Themes](https://jamstackthemes.dev/ssg/jekyll/) (they have a few cool ones) and customized from there.

### Hacked Jekyll

> Hacked-jekyll is a "microtheme that looks like JSON". 

> I loved the coder/hacker theme and used it as a homepage. I expanded it by adding a photo gallery, a draggable navigation bar (idea inspired by draggable posts on [Anon](http://anon.com.hk)), and a blog page. 

> The outcome: <https://github.com/nadath/hacking-jekyll>, thanks to the following references.
1. [A simple image gallery in Jekyll without plugins](https://dmnfarrell.github.io/software/jekyll-galleries)
2. [Create a Draggable HTML Element](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_draggable.asp)

> I'm thinking up something cool/weird to customize the blog page further. Let's see how it'd go.

> For now, we've got to move on to the next step,

### Learn a niche skill or new language

> While building this site, I've been switching tasks between learning Blender and Javascript. 

> Blender is common among artists but having animation skills as a developer would be some sort of niche, wouldn't it? Plus, I've got a project in mind related to open source digital art application -- it's a secret. 

> So I started some tutorials on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) and [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). They're awesome and free, but I get bored and distracted easily. 

> I think I've got a hang of how to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript in building a website, so that's good enough for a start.

> Got to focus on Blender now.

> Let's go!
