TLDR; I added more draggable stuff.

### Questioning myself yet again

I was hit by reality, through an interview for a developer job, of the level of my skill. My dreams are infinitely higher than what I could achieve with my current level. I always do that, unrealistic thinking, and disappoint myself.

My creative tap was blocked.

For a whole week.

I continued going to work as usual. It was not so bad after all. All those doubts had gone and I feel this is where I belong, for the moment. 

I'm not thinking of running away again. But this developer thing, it's my weekend getaway and I'll need it to keep me sane.

### To the main thing

I was itching to create the draggable posts on my blog page, like on Anon. Took hours to come up with this one. Apprently with only marginal experience in editing Jekyll and Tumblr themes, this is what you get.

The saviour yet again: [an answer on Stackoverfow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/63857834/22305530) to the same question.

I customized the code to make the posts as the draggable elements, scatter them at random, and match the hacker theme I already had going.

It's not done yet, but at least I got the itch out of my head.

Yeay.
