TLDR; I added more draggable stuff. I was itching to create draggable posts because it's fun dragging them around. Taking inspiration from Anon, I merged the concept with the Terminal app look to fit the theme. How it came about, is a rather long-winded story..

### Questioning myself yet again

I was hit by the realest reality, through an interview for a developer job, of the level of my skill. It went terribly.

But all praise to God I finally realized that 1. I know nothing; 2. There can be no such job as what I imagined (unless I created the job); 3. My dreams are infinitely higher than what I could achieve. I always do that, unrealistic thinking, and disappoint myself.

In the wake of the disappointment, my creative tap was blocked.

For two whole weeks. And the itch about the draggable thing was bothering me in my showers.

I went to work as usual. It was not so bad after all. All my doubts about it had gone and I feel I am where I belong, for the moment. 

A career pivot may not happen soon, but I'm going through with the plan, coding is my weekend getaway and I'll need it to keep me sane.

### To the main thing

After coffee today, my creative tap flows. The disappointment had passed it seems. What I did first was to modify the code for the draggable navbar to make multiple elements draggable. It didn't work.

Stackoverflow to the rescue. I found an answer to the same question I had. Apparently, the method I used for the nav bar only works for a single element, there's no way around it.

I customized this [code snippet](https://stackoverflow.com/a/63857834/22305530) to make site posts as the draggable elements, scatter them at random, and match the hacker theme I already had going.

It's not completely finished yet, but at least I got the itch out of my head.

Thank God now I can sleep.
