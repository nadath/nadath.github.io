TLDR; I added more draggable stuff.

I was itching to create the draggable posts on the blog page. Took almost a day to come up with this one. Apprently with no strong foundation in HTML/CSS/Javascript, and only marginal experience in editing Tumblr themes, this is what you get.

The saviour yet again: [an answer on Stackoverfow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/63857834/22305530) to the same question.

I customized the code to make the posts as the draggable elements, scatter them at random, and match the hacker theme I already had going.

It's not done yet, but at least I got the itch out of my head.

Yeay.
